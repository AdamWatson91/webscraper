# unit testing ideas:
# 1. Check that the uuid4 does not duplicate
# 2. Check it gets the images for each, could probaly att wait for element to my functions for safety
# 3. Add extra element in does it still work
# 4. Change website, does it still work
# 5. If there is a duplicate id will it error
# 6. Does the data scraped match the expected values (foudn it doesn't seem to line 1/4 or brackets like (12 Ounce))
# 7. using find elements when there is only one element in the multiple scraper - does it still work?
# 8. Try with Firefox?
